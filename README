Contained in the Zip file should be:

clue-2-1-0-alpha-zeta-1-1-0             The Server and Display
clue-2-1-0-alpha-zeta-1-1-0.so          The Library to Link Against
cluedemo-2-1-0-alpha-zeta-1-1-0         The Exmple Message Sender
Clue.h                                  The Header to Include
Localized Strings                       Translations for the Server
Sample                                  Example Message Sender
Documentation                           HTML Documentation

You should begin by moving "clue-2-1-0-alpha-zeta-1-1-0.so" to your
"/home/config/lib" folder.  This can be done easily by dragging and dropping it
onto the included folder called "Place clue-2-1-0-alpha-zeta-1-1-0.so Here".

Included in this download is a full sample application that shows some ways in which you can use Clue, and its code is located in the "Sample"
folder.

Wherever you end up placing the Clue application, you should move the "Documentation" folder to the same place.  The "File/Help" menu
will be looking for the "index.htm" file in the Documentation folder where the app was started from.

NOTE: Need to update documentation for this next release.  Being as this is a
development release, this document isn't finished!!!  My major focus with the
next release is to add a timeline; and to harden the code!!!  It's a big job, so
that is why I'm releasing this dev version, to get something out there so people
know this project isn't dead.  If you can be of any help with language
translation, I would appreciate it very much.  I still have some hard-coded
strings in my latest code, so the "localized strings" file will change as I get
closer to the final release.

Also included is a file called "Localized Strings".  This file contains all of
the string definitions that Clue uses.  In almost all of the languages, there
are some non-localized strings.  If you are fluent in any of the languages
(German, Czech, Russian, French, or Portuguese) and can
help by translating the English string, I would appreciate it greatly!!!  The
file has to be compiled into the program, so just changing
the strings won't change Clue.

Thanks,
Mathew Hounsell

P.S. Thank you Jeff Braun for creating and open sourcing this fantastic tool.
